# Notes on readability:
# - We avoid `pts[:, None, :] - pts[None, :, :]`, which uses NumPy broadcasting
#   to build an (n,n,d) array of all differences in one shot.
# - We also avoid `np.triu_indices`, which finds the upper-triangle indices
#   (i<j) of that big matrix. Instead, we explicitly loop over i<j,
#   which is clearer for understanding exactly which pairs we're computing.
